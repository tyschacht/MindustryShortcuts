# MindustryShortcuts
AutoHotKey Script to enable shortcuts and quick item navigation in Mindustry


Mindustry lacks hotkeys to allow for item shortcuts or even item traversal in an efficient manner.   Until this feature is added, I made an attempt to create an AutoHotKey script to do what I could.

## Controls
* <TAB>    -  Go BACK an item category
* Q        -  Go FORWARD an item category
* <SPACE>  -  Go FORWARD an item
* <SHIFT+SPACE>  - Go BACK an item

## Hotkeys
* 1 thru 8
* Activates the item associated with this hotkey

Hotkey items are set in the Mindustry.ahk file in the SHORTCUT CONFIG section by defining the category number and the item number.   The first item in each category/section is zero.
